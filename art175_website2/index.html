It is to my utmost relief that she was asleep throughout most of the journey, for I fear to think of the night terrors that the forest would have brought upon her. The trees seem so much more alive and sinister at the witching hour. The forest breaths like a dying man. Every hoot of an owl reverberated in the mind as a demonic howl. Every moonlit shadow takes on the form of a ghostly specter. What was almost just as frightening about our journey through the forest was the fact that Mary remained completely silent in her slumber. It almost appeared as if she was dead.</p><p>New Havington is located just outside of the forest. This town feels entirely different from the woodlands, as if a barrier separates the two lands. I believe this town will be a fine place to settle down and raise our family. If not, I know Mary will say, “George, I can’t say I didn’t warn you; moving West was a bad idea.” I wish she would trust my judgement a bit more.</p></div>
