<div class="side1 "><p>January 23rd, 1908</p><p>Mary and I arrived in New Havington before sunset. It is to my utmost relief that she was asleep throughout most of the journey, for I fear to think of the night terrors that the forest would have brought upon her. The trees seem so much more alive and sinister at the witching hour. The forest breaths like a dying man. Every hoot of an owl reverberated in the mind as a demonic howl. Every moonlit shadow takes on the form of a ghostly specter. What was almost just as frightening about our journey through the forest was the fact that Mary remained completely silent in her slumber. It almost appeared as if she was dead.</p><p>New Havington is located just outside of the forest. This town feels entirely different from the woodlands, as if a barrier separates the two lands. I believe this town will be a fine place to settle down and raise our family. If not, I know Mary will say, “George, I can’t say I didn’t warn you; moving West was a bad idea.” I wish she would trust my judgement a bit more.</p></div>

 <div class="side2"><p>January 25th, 1908</p><p>We have finally settled into the new house. Just a bit of cleaning and a few new curtains should make this place feel like a home. The floorboards creak incessantly, and the fireplace needs a cleaning, but I think we’ve got a good deal on this place. The bank had little information on the previous owners; said they kept to themselves and, one night, just up and left. Mary has hardly slept since we’ve been here; I think she is just homesick. Once the baby is born, she’ll be a lot happier</p></div>

 <div class="side5"><p>Febuary 2nd, 1908</p><p>There is a view of the forest from our bedroom window. About an acre of the forest is part of our land, but I won’t dare go near it. Mary tells me I’m overreacting. She says she would like to see the rest of our land, perhaps build a conservatory out there. I tell her, “maybe after the baby is born.” It should not be long now, just about 4 months. That should give me some time to work up the nerve.</p></div>
   <div class="child side6"><span>Side3</span><span>Side3</span></div>
    <div class="side7"><p id="target2">Febuary 4th, 1908</p><p>I returned home from work today to Mary standing out on the porch. She looked positively spooked as she ran to me in tears and refused to enter the house. I asked her what had happened, to which she replied, “someone was watching me through the locks.” I had no reason to not believe her, considering the state she was in. I grabbed the axe from the shed and Mary reluctantly followed me into the house.</p><p>Everything was dead silent except for the occasional sound of a floorboard creaking. Which could not be pinpointed to source from any one area of the house. We searched the first floor, seeing nothing of interest. Mary, refusing to leave my side, followed me up the stairs to the second floor. Our bedroom door was the only open door in the house, so we made our way there. I was nervous, likely secondhand nerves from the vice-like grip my wife’s hands had as she bit her nails into my arm.</p><p>I raised my axe as we edged through the doorway. A floorboard creaked once again from somewhere in the house, making both me and Mary stop and hold our breaths. I looked around the room and under the bed, but no one was in the room. I determined it was safe and left Mary there as I checked the rest of the house. Not a single thing was misplaced. The doors were locked and the windows were closed, it seemed that Mary had not touched a single thing since I had left that morning. </p><p>It took some convincing, but Mary agreed to stay in the house that night despite her worries. I worried as well, but most of my worry was placed on Mary. Perhaps she still has not settled into the new house, or the baby is messing with her emotions. She has some friends in town and she has agreed to spend some time with them tomorrow. Best she not stay locked up in the house all day. That could certainly drive anyone to madness.</p><p>As I’m writing this, Mary is fast asleep, she would not come into the room until I did. Poor thing is genuinely afraid of something. I would be asleep too if I didn’t have this itch at the back of my head as if someone is watching me. And maybe it is Mary’s ideas getting in my head, but I have the distinct sense that someone, or something, is looking through the bedroom door’s keyhole. </p><span id="statusText2"></span></div>
